# LRC_files
My collection of synced lyrics. Majority of LRC is made by me, check for `[by: RevolutionVoid]`.

## Types of files
1. `.lrc` Standard LRC (instrumental sections have timestamps without text).
2. `.al.lrc` AutoLyric 2* LRC (has fade-out timestamps). May include 2-letter language abbreviations for translations/romanizations, or 'multi' for a combination.
3. `.karaoke.lrc` AutoLyric 5* LRC (timestamps for each syllable).
4. `.aldl.lrc` AutoLyric LRC not made by me.
